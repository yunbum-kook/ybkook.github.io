## 2020
* August 11, 2020: Discrete Math Seminar, [IBS Discrete Mathematics Group](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr), Daejeon, Korea.
	* [Vertex Sparsification for Edge Connectivity](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/event/2020-08-11/); [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLo7uZocI9o)
	* In this talk, I introduce the notion of "vertex sparsification" with a line of research in this topic and then bring up our particular form of sparsifiers, *connectivity-c mimicking network*, with algorithms for them. I focus more on mathematical aspects in this problem, so I give a sketch of proof for a provable upper bound on the optimal size of sparsifiers.
