## 2020
* August 25, 2020: 26th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowl- edge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDD), San Diego, CA, United States (Virtual).
	* [Incremental Lossless Graph Summarization](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/schedule). ([Short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq5vVPBopU8&feature=youtu.be)I[Long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHVx642GoaI&feature=youtu.be))
	* In this talk, I introduce our work "Incremental Lossless Graph Summarization" published in KDD 20. Beginning with what graph summarization is and why it is important, I give a motivation for "incremental" graph summarization. Then I elaborate on our scheme for incrementally updating a summarized graph and on what techniques are employed in order to achieve fast update and effective compression.

* August 11, 2020: Discrete Math Seminar, [IBS Discrete Mathematics Group](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr), Daejeon, Korea.
	* [Vertex Sparsification for Edge Connectivity](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/event/2020-08-11/). ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLo7uZocI9o))
	* In this talk, I introduce the notion of "vertex sparsification" with a line of research in this topic and then bring up our particular form of sparsifiers, *connectivity-c mimicking network*, with algorithms to find them. I focus more on mathematical aspects in this problem, so I give a sketch of proof for a provable upper bound on the optimal size of sparsifiers.
