## 2021
* January 12, 2021: 15th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), Virtual.  
	* Vertex Sparsification for Edge Connectivity. (Video: [Short](), [Long]()


## 2020
* November 19, 2020: 20th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (IEEE ICDM), Virtual.  
	* [Evolution of Real-world Hypergraphs: Patterns and Models without Oracles](http://39.104.72.142:8080/icdm2020/detailed-program/). ([Video]())
	* In this talk, I introduce my work “Evolution of Real-world Hypergraphs: Patterns and Models without Oracles” published in IEEE ICDM 20, aiming to deliver valuable insights into real-world hypergraphs. After taking a close look at macroscopic static and temporal patterns of real-world hypergraphs, I present a random growth model which makes the observed patterns naturally emerge.  


* August 25, 2020: 26th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDD), Virtual.
	* [Incremental Lossless Graph Summarization](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/schedule). ()
	* In this talk, I introduce my work “Incremental Lossless Graph Summarization” published in KDD 20. Beginning with the definition of graph summarization and its importance, I give a motivation for “incremental” graph summarization. Then I elaborate on our scheme for incrementally updating a summarized graph and on what techniques are employed to achieve fast update and effective compression.


* August 11, 2020: Discrete Math Seminar, [IBS Discrete Mathematics Group](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr), Daejeon, Korea.
	* [Vertex Sparsification for Edge Connectivity](https://dimag.ibs.re.kr/event/2020-08-11/). ([Video]())
	* In this talk, I introduce the notion of “vertex sparsification” with a line of research on this topic and then bring up our particular form of sparsifiers, connectivity-c mimicking network, with algorithms to find them. I focus more on mathematical aspects in this problem, so I give a sketch of proof for a provable upper bound on the optimal size of sparsifiers.
