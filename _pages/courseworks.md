    <summary><b>Advanced Calculus 3 (고급미적분학3)</b></summary>

* Note
	* This supplementary material was written when I was 2nd grade highschool (KSA) student. Lectures for this course were super fast and omitted some details, so I wrote a detail proofs on important theorem in calculus, filling those gaps in the lectures.
	* Feel free to correct me!
* Info
	* Textbook: Vector Calculus, by Jerrold E. Marsden, Anthony Tromba
	* Year: 2013 Spring
