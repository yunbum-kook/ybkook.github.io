### Advanced Calculus 3 (고급미적분학3)
* __Note__
	* This supplementary material was written when I was 2nd grade highschool (KSA) student. Lectures for this course were super fast and omitted some details, so I wrote a detail proofs on important theorem in calculus, filling those gaps in the lectures.
	* Feel free to correct me!
* __Info__
	* Textbook: Vector Calculus, by Jerrold E. Marsden, Anthony Tromba
	* Year: 2013 Spring

### Mathematical Analysis I, II (MAS241, MAS242)
* __Note__
	* It was professor Shin's last teaching on MAS241 and MAS242. For a long time, her course had been famous for heavy loads. Every class had a quiz on 13 T/F problems and these course required three 12 hour exams during a semester.
	* All quiz problems with solutions are shared as below. In a way that I struggled to find out counter examples for FALSE problems and to prove for TRUE problems, I believe that I had mathematically and logically grown up.
