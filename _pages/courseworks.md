    <summary><b>Advanced Calculus 3 (고급미적분학3)</b></summary>

__Note 1:  This supplementary material was written when I was 2nd grade highschool (KSA) student. Lectures for this course were super fast and omitted some details, so I wrote a detail proofs on important theorem in calculus, filling those gaps in the lectures.__  
__Note 2: Feel free to correct me!</b>__
