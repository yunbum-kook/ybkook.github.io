## The Probabilistic Method (MAS583) 
* __Note__
	* Textbook: The Probabilistic Method, 4th edition (Noga Alon and Joel H. Spencer) 
	* The homework files below are my solutions for exercises in the textbook "The Probabilistic Method (4th edition, Alon and Spencer)". Parts of ideas come from friends and papers on the Internet. Feel free to correct me.
	* These solution files will have been updated through this semester.

## Mathematical Analysis I, II (MAS241, MAS242)
* __Note__
	* It was professor Sujin Shin’s last teaching on MAS241 and MAS242. For a long time, her course had been known for heavy loads: students had a daily quiz on 13 T/F problems and three 12 hour exams during a semester.  
	* All quiz problems with solutions are shared below. Much as I learned a lot from struggling to find out counterexamples for FALSE problems and to prove for TRUE problems, trying this would be a good chance to mathematically and logically step up.   
* __Info__
	* Textbook: Lecture notes from professor
	* Instructor: Sujin Shin
	* Year: 2015 Spring (MAS241) and Fall (MAS242)

## Advanced Calculus 3 (고급미적분학3)
* __Note__
	* This supplementary material was written when I was a second-grade high school (KSA) student. Lectures were delivered so fast and omitted several details, so I wrote up detailed proofs of important theorems in calculus.  
* __Info__
	* Textbook: Vector Calculus, by Jerrold E. Marsden, Anthony Tromba
	* Year: 2013 Spring
