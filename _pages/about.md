I am a senior undergraduate in [Department of Mathematical Science](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/) at KAIST. I am interested in theoretical computer science, especially algorithmic problems (sampling, optimization, learning etc.), with a focus on design and analysis of provably efficient algorithms.
