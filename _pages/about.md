I am a senior undergraduate at [Department of Mathematical Science](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/) in KAIST. I am interested in theoretical computer science, especially algorithmic problems (sampling, optimization, learning etc.), with a focus on design and analysis of provably efficient algorithms.
I am also interested in probabilistic combinatorics and data mining [(CV)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hqsu6y1s39xk5nq/cv_english.pdf?dl=0).
