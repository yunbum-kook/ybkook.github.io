I am a senior undergraduate in [Department of Mathematical Science](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/), double majoring in [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr) at KAIST. My field of interest lies in analysis, graph theory, combinatorics, and algorithmic aspects of CS, and I am especially interested in applying mathematical knowledge to problem solving. My full CV is at [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1hcryg2ppayjb4y/cv_english.pdf?dl=0).
