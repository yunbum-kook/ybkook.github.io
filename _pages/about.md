I am a senior undergraduate at [Department of Mathematical Science](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/) in KAIST. My field of interest lies in algorithmic aspects of CS (graph, streaming, randomized algorithms), graph theory, optimization, theoretical machine learning, and data mining. I am open to any field as long as it requires mathematical knowledge for problem-solving! [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hqsu6y1s39xk5nq/cv_english.pdf?dl=0).
