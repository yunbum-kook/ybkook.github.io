I am a senior undergraduate at [Department of Mathematical Science](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/), double majoring in [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr) at KAIST. My field of interest lies in algorithmic aspects of CS (graph, streaming, randomized algorithms), graph theory, optimization, theoretical machine learning and data mining, and I am especially interested in applying mathematical knowledge to problem solving. My full CV is at [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hqsu6y1s39xk5nq/cv_english.pdf?dl=0).
